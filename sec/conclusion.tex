\section{Conclusions and future work} \label{s:conclusion}

In this article we introduced new formulas describing cup-$i$ products on simplicial cochains over $\Ftwo$.
As proven in work being finalized \cite{medina2018axiomatic}, these formulas give raise to a cup-$i$ construction isomorphic to those introduced by Steenrod and others, but their specific form allowed us to development a fast algorithm computing Steenrod squares on the mod 2 cohomology of finite simplicial complexes.
Our method is based on the determination of the universal support of a representative of $Sq^k\big( [\alpha] \big)$ given the support of a cocycle $\alpha$, and it is therefore less impacted by the size of the simplicial complex than traditional methods that iterate over all simplices of dimension $\bars{\alpha} + k$.

In future work we will treat the general prime $p$ case.
More specifically, we will describe new formulas defining cup-$(p,i)$ products on simplicial cochains over $\Fp$.
These new formulas will lead to fast computations of mod $p$ Steenrod operations for simplicial complexes, and, as in the work of Cantero-Mor\'an \cite{cantero-moran2020khovanov} over $\Ftwo$, to the definition of Steenrod operations on Khovanov homology over $\Fp$ for a general prime $p$.
