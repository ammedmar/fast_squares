In this section we present a proof-of-concept comparison between the existing method for the computation of Steenrod squares on simplicial complexes, based on Gonz\'alez-D\'iaz--Real's approach \cite[Corollary 3.2]{gonzalez-diaz1999steenrod}, and the one introduced here.
We used a \verb|Python| implementation of our algorithm and the open source computer algebra system \verb|SAGE v9.3.rc3| \cite{sagemath} which includes an implementation of the existing method written by John Palmieri.

Given a topological space $X$ the \textit{suspension} of $X$ is the topological space $\suspension X$ obtained from $X \times [0,1]$ by collapsing $X \times \{0\}$ and $X \times \{1\}$ to points.
Suspension is a natural construction and, for each integer $i \neq 0$, there is an isomorphism $H^i(X) \cong H^{i+1}(\suspension X)$, which can be extended to $i = 0$ by considering reduced cohomology.
A crucial fact about Steenrod squares is that for reduced cohomology with mod 2 coefficients, all operations commuting with the suspension isomorphism are generated by the Steenrod squares.

The real projective plane $\RP^2$, obtained by identifying antipodal points in a sphere, is the simplest space with a non-trivial Steenrod square.
Its reduced mod 2 cohomology has a single basis element $x_i \in \widetilde{H}^i(\RP^2; \Ftwo)$ for $i \in \{1, 2\}$ and satisfies $Sq^1(x_1) = x_2$.
Therefore, its $i^\th$ suspension $\suspension^i \RP^2$ has a non-trivial operation given by $Sq^1(\suspension^i x_1) = \suspension^i x_2$.

We now describe the pipeline we followed for the comparison.
In \verb|SAGE| we produced a simplicial complex model of $\suspension^i \RP^2$ for each $i \in \{0, \dots, 10\}$ using the methods \verb|RealProjectiveSpace(2)| and \verb|suspension(i)|.
We used the method \verb|cohomology_ring(GF(2))| on this model and on its output the method \verb|basis()| to obtain a model for the element $\suspension^i x_1$.
Finally, we applied the method \verb|Sq(k)| to it with $k=1$ and record the execution time of this last step.
We implemented in \verb|Python| an alternative for the method \verb|Sq(k)| based on \cref{a:algorithm} and modified the above pipeline accordingly.
We recorded the average execution time of these implementations for each $\suspension^i \RP^2$ over $\lfloor 10000/2^i \rfloor$ runs for each $i \in \{0, \dots, 10\}$.
The results of this pipeline are presented in \cref{f:comparison}.
%We notice that the execution time of the implementation based on our algorithm remains constant whereas the one in \verb|SAGE| grows exponentially.

More specifically, for each $i \in \{0, \dots, 10\}$ we timed the computation of the non-trivial Steenrod square in the cohomology of the $i^\th$ suspension of the real projective plane, averaged over a number of runs equal to the integral part of $\frac{10000}{2^i}$.}
