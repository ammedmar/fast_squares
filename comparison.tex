\section{Comparison}

In this section we use \verb|SAGE v9.2| to give a proof of concept comparison between the Gonz\'alez-D\'iaz--Real algorithm for the computation of Steenrod squares and the one introduced here.

We will focus on suspensions of the real projective plane remarking that the present results have been checked to be representative of the situation in general.\footnote{Please see ... for more comprehensive comparison data}

The real projective plane

We will consider the $i\th$ suspension $\suspension^i \RP^2$ of the real projective plane and the only non-trivial operation on its cohomology $Sq^1(x_{i+1})$.

In \verb|SAGE| we use the method \verb|RealProjectiveSpace(2)| to produce a simplicial complex model for $\RP^2$ and the method \verb|suspension(i)| to give explicit models of $\suspension^i \RP^2$ for any $i \in \{0, \dots, 9\}$.
Given such models, a basis for their cohomology can be computed using \verb|cohomology_ring(GF(2))| and we apply \verb|Sq(k)| with $k=1$ to the basis element in degree $i+1$. 

We have implemented in \verb|Python| an alternative for the method \verb|Sq(k)| based on Algorithm~\ref{a:algorithm}, and recorded the average execution time of these implementations for each $\suspension^i \RP^2$ over $\lfloor 10000/2^i \rfloor$ runs for each $i \in \{0, \dots, 9\}$
As presented in Figure~\ref{f:comparison}, the execution time of these algorithms differs exponentially.
